- Set a font-family for the page.
- Use readable font sizes and spacing ( line-height , margins).
- Make headings visually distinct from body text.
- Use margin , padding , and border intentionally
- Explicitly set margin and padding for at least one major section or container.
- Use a border in at least one place (card, section, nav, image, etc.).
